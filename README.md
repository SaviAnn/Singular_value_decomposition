SVD based on the image processing is a great and example for clear understanding its meaning. In linear algebra, the concept of singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a crucial role in factorizing a real or complex matrix. 
It offers a generalized version of the eigendecomposition, which is applicable to any matrix of dimensions.

To be precise, when dealing with a complex matrix M of dimensions m x n, the singular value decomposition can be expressed as the following factorization:

M = UΣV^\*,
where:
U represents an m x m complex unitary matrix, 
Σ is an m x nrectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers along the diagonal, 
V is an n x n complex unitary matrix, and V^* denotes the conjugate transpose of V.
